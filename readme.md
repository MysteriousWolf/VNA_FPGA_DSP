# VNA_Config

This repository contains the Verilog code and FPGA configuration files for implementing a phase detector, amplitude detector, and RBW (Resolution Bandwidth) filter in the VNA (Vector Network Analyzer) project. Designed for use with Lattice Radiant tools, the project provides flexible FPGA-based signal processing components that can be adapted for various configurations.
